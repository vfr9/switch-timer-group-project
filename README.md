Things we learned and enjoyed about this Project:
    -We enjoyed learning new methods of deploying a Python Flask app other than Fly. It was very satisfying when we finally got the deployment
    working after working on the project so long.
    -We learned a lot more about CSS from our stylization of our app than we did with any of the previous projects. Any future
    projects we do that use CSS and HTML will look much better as a result.
    
Things we didn't enjoy or things we wanted to learn from this Project:
    -We wanted to have some YouTube API generated links for some features on this project but never got around to it in order to 
    give proper development time to the rest of the features.
    -We didn't enjoy the small time frame with Thanksgiving break in the middle of the project development time hurting a lot of
    dev time we could have given the project to fix any problems we have with the final product.
    
Technical Requirements:
    -We ran the website using a Flask Server.
    -We used a REST API to pull information about the show Bob's Burgers on the break page of the site.
    -We used a React frontend in order to make the site look better.
    -We Beautified the site in order to make it presentable to any users.
    
Streatch Features:
    -We attempted to create a system to encourage the user to come back to the site but didn't have the time to fully implement it so
    we only have about half of the feature that plays a sound to get the user to return or know when break/work time has ended/started.
